                For our hosts, SpareLot charges a small 4% hosting fee taken from each monthly payout. This small payment gives hosts the ability to list and advertise on SpareLot. Additionally, it allows SpareLot to further ensure the safety of its hosts and renters.

                A cancellation fee will be applied when a host cancels a reservation after it has been confirmed or earlier than the designated end date. Renters will receive a full refund for that month and the booking will cancel for following months.
