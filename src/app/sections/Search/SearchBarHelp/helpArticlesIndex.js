These payments are never received by SpareLot but rather provide compensation to either hosts or renters. The structure of penalty fees can be found below:\n\n- <strong>Late Fees:</strong> Late payment fees apply when a renter fails to make a payment by the due date. If a renter fails to make a payment by the due date but successfully pays within 7 days of the original date, a small 5% late fee will be added to the cost of that month’s rent which will be paid to the host. If a renter fails to make a payment past 7 days of the due date, a 10% fee will be added to the original cost of the month for each week a payment is missed. If the renter is unable to make a payment past 4 weeks of the due date, their storage agreement will be revoked.\n- <strong>Renter Cancellation Fee:</strong> Cancellation fees apply when a renter cancels a reservation after a certain period. The amount of the fee is determined as a percentage of the total booking amount, depending on how close to the start date the cancellation occurs. This fee is transferred straight to the host. The fee structure can be viewed below:\n  - Less than 24 hours after approval by the host: 0% fee\n  - On monthly renewal date: 0% fee\n  - 4 days or more before start date: 0% fee\n  - 4 days or less before start date: 25% fee\n- <strong>Host Cancellation Fee:</strong> A cancellation fee will be applied when a host cancels a reservation after it has been confirmed or earlier than the designated end date. This is a simple $30 fine paid to the renter as compensation for their early eviction."

This fee enables us to maintain and improve our platform, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience for all users."
